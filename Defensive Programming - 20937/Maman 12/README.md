#  Defensive Programming Course Project  

This project is part of a Defensive Programming course in C++ and includes the following tasks:  

---

##  Task 1: Vulnerability Analysis and Fix (20%)  
- Analyze a credit eligibility function for a promotion in a credit card company.  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Identify and define the security vulnerability in the function.  
  - Propose an attack exploiting the vulnerability.  
  - Fix the code to prevent the attack.  
  - Document the vulnerability, the attack method, and the implemented fix.  
- **Submission:** Report in PDF or Word format.

##  Task 2: Exploit and Defense of Input Handling (80%)  
- Investigate a C++ program that echoes its input to `stdout`.  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Compile and run the program to understand its behavior.  
  - Identify a vulnerability and exploit it to call an unreachable function.  
  - Fix the code to eliminate the vulnerability.  
  - Document the vulnerability, the exploitation technique, and the security fix.  
- **Environment Requirements:**  
  - Disable ASLR and compile in 32-bit (x86) mode.  
  - Use Debug configuration for testing the exploit.  
  - The program will be evaluated on Ubuntu Linux using `gcc`.  
- **Submission:** Corrected code and a research report in PDF or Word format, recommended as a `.zip` file.
