#  Defensive Programming Course Project  

This project is part of a Defensive Programming course in C++ and includes the following tasks:  

---

##  Task 1: Polymorphism Analysis (10%)  
- Analyze and explain the output of given C++ code, focusing on polymorphism behavior.  
- Provide a detailed explanation of how polymorphism is implemented in C++.  
- **Submission:** Explanation in PDF or Word format.  

---

##  Task 2: Debugging and Explanation (10%)  
- Analyze provided code using a `Point` class to identify and fix a bug.  
- Explain the cause of the bug and the solution implemented.  
- **Submission:** Corrected code and explanation in PDF or Word format, recommended as a .zip file.

## Task 3: USocial Social Network Implementation (80%)  
- Implement a social network named **USocial** with the following class structure:  
  - **USocial:** Manages users and posts.  
  - **Media (Abstract Base Class):** Represents media objects (Photo, Audio, Video).  
  - **Post:** Contains text and an optional media object.  
  - **User:** Regular user class.  
  - **BusinessUser:** Inherits from User, with additional functionalities.  
  - **Message:** Represents messages between users.  
- **Design Requirements:**  
  - Proper memory management with dynamic allocation.  
  - Use of polymorphism with virtual functions.  
  - Exception handling for error scenarios.  
  - Recommended use of C++11 features (e.g., lambdas, `auto`).  
  - Documentation and comments required for all functions.  
- **Submission:** Source code (`.h` and `.cpp` files) in a `.zip` file, including a main file with example runs.
